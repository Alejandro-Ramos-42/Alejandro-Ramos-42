## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alejandro David Ramos Alvarez, but you can call me Alex

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on get_next_line which is a function that reads a buffer-size amount of date (stated at compilation time) from a file descriptor and outputs the first line of that file. If you call the function several times, you get more lines as output. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Networking and Cibersecurity following the CISCO academy and also german on Duolingo.
